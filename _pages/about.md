Welcome to my webpage :slightly_smiling_face:. 
I am currently a postdoctoral scholar in the [Department of Earth and Space Sciences at the University of Washington](https://ess.uw.edu/). My research interests are exploring nature using seismic interferometry and expanding seismology into the 4th dimension of time.
